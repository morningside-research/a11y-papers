### Motivation

After buying an E-ink tablet and trying to use it for my papers, I realized a lot of research PDFâ€™s are not Colorblind-safe. My experience using e-ink is qualitatively different.

This made me realize that it is possible to use AI methods to enhance accessibility (a11y). In the ideal world, perhaps a11y specialists hired at journals would work to make PDF documents more accessible but even if that happened, we would still have a long backlog of inaccessible historical documents that are not colorblind-safe, let alone readable by anyone on a screen reader. 

This is a tragic state. An an opportunity to use AI for good.


### Candidate Solutions

There are many possible paths. This is a resource to evaluate several options and develop them.
